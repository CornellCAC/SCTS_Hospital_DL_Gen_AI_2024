# Run on Colab

It is recommended to run these Python Jupyter Notebooks on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as that was the development platform used.  Model training was accelerated with a Colab Pro+ Nvidia V100 GPU, to replicate please consider modifying settings accordingly.

Please consult the previous lecture [Intermediate Python Course](https://github.com/CornellCAC/SCTS_IntermediatePython?tab=readme-ov-file#2-run-jupyter-in-the-cloud) for more details on running with Colab.

# Data available from Kaggle

Datasets and notebook content used in these tutorials were derived from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) materials, creating a Kaggle account can provide smooth access to those sources and further exploratory materials.
